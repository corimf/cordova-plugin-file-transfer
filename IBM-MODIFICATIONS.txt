- CVE-2015-5204
- Full description:  For Android applications that allow HTTP headers to be 
set by the File Transfer plugin, the file being uploaded can manipulate the
header through non-ASCII text in the filename. This allows for for cookies to 
be forged by the Cordova application, or for the file payload to be replaced 
in some situations. Remotely hosted applications and applications developed 
with Cordova that allow the user to manually enter the filename are especially 
vulnerable to this issue. The solution is to limit the characters in the headers 
to just ASCII text.
